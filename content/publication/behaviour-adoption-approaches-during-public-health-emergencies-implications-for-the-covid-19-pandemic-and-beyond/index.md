abstract: Human behaviour will continue to play an important role as the world
  grapples with public health threats. In this paper, we draw from the emerging
  evidence on behaviour adoption during diverse public health emergencies to
  develop a framework that contextualises behaviour adoption vis-Ã -vis a
  combination of top-down, intermediary and bottom-up approaches. Using the
  COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we operationalise the contextual framework
  to demonstrate how these three approaches differ in terms of their
  implementation, underlying drivers of action, enforcement, reach and uptake.
  We illustrate how blended strategies that include all three approaches can
  help accelerate and sustain protective behaviours that will remain important
  even when safe and effective vaccines become more widely available. As the
  world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic and prepares to respond to
  (re)emerging public health threats, our contextual framework can inform the
  design, implementation, tracking and evaluation of comprehensive public health
  and social measures during health emergencies.
