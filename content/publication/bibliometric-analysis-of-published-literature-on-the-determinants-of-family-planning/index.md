abstract: "Our study reviews published literature about the determinants of
  family planning, specifically studies that examined contraceptive use,
  non-use, and unmet need. We sought to understand the state of knowledge in the
  field, particularly as it relates to when, where, and by whom that knowledge
  is produced. Our extensive scoping review identified all articles published
  between 2000-2016 on the determinants of family planning in FP2020 countries.
  We use bibliometric tools and techniques to identify authors’ institutional
  and national affiliations, as well as their citation counts to assess how
  authorship characteristics contribute to knowledge production. We found that
  most research on family planning was collaborative and focused on a single
  country of interest. Teams of authors had the highest rates of publication
  across all family planning outcomes, with teams of men and women representing
  the largest authorship type based on gender and teams from the Global South
  representing the largest group based on global location. However, our
  bibliometric analysis found that characteristics associated with most family
  planning behavior research were not those associated with citation counts. In
  particular, research published by authors affiliated with Global South
  institutions received significantly less citations compared to groups of
  authors affiliated with institutions in the Global North and Global South.
  Citations counts are often seen as a measure of scientific impact and
  attention paid by the scientific community to specific research results. Our
  findings indicate preference for certain authorship characteristics over
  others based on citations, implicating concerns about knowledge diffusion
  disparities in family planning literature. "
