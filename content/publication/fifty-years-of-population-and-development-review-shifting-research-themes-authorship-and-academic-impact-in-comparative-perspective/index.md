abstract: To mark the Population and Development Review's (PDR) 50th
  anniversary, we analyze its contributions to the landscape of population
  research. We examine the trajectory of research published in PDR and compare
  it with two leading and long-standing English-language demographic journals,
  Demography and Population Studies. Through a computational meta-analysis of
  all articles published across the three journals over the past 50 years, we
  explore trends in knowledge production focusing on research themes and
  authorship characteristics. Our automated text analysis highlights the
  prominence of fertility, family, and mortality themes across all three
  journals, but with PDR placing greater emphasis on development, policy, and
  population growth. Interest in migration and health-related topics has also
  increased over time across all journals, including PDR. Our analysis of
  authorship characteristics reveals a persistent overrepresentation of scholars
  located in Global North countries, particularly the United States, across all
  three journals. While the prominence of the United States has declined in PDR,
  European representation has grown, alongside a relative decline in Global
  South authors compared with earlier decades. Over the past 50 years, all three
  journals have had a male-dominated authorship, but gender balance has improved
  significantly, reaching near parity in recent years.
