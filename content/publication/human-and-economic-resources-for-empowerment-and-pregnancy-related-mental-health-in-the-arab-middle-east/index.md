abstract: This systematic review synthesizes research on the influence of human
  and economic resources for women’s empowerment on their pre- and postnatal
  mental health, understudied in the Arab world. We include articles using
  quantitative methods from PubMed and Web of Science. Two researchers reviewed
  databases and selected articles, double reviewing 5% of articles designated
  for inclusion. Twenty-four articles met inclusion criteria. All 24 articles
  measured depression as an outcome, and three included additional mental health
  outcomes. Nine of 17 studies found an inverse association between education
  and depression; two of 12 studies found contradictory associations between
  employment and depression, and four of six studies found a positive
  association between financial stress and depression. These results suggest
  that there is a negative association between education and depression and a
  positive association between financial stress and depression among women in
  the Arab world. Firm conclusions warrant caution due to limited studies
  meeting inclusion criteria and large heterogeneity in mental health scales
  used, assessment measures, and definitions of human and economic resources for
  women’s empowerment. It is likely that education reduces depression among
  postpartum women and that financial stress increases their depression. These
  findings can be used to aid in the design of interventions to improve mother
  and child outcomes. However, more research in the Arab world is needed on the
  relationship between human and economic resources for women’s empowerment and
  perinatal mental health, and more consistency is needed in how resources and
  mental health are measured.
