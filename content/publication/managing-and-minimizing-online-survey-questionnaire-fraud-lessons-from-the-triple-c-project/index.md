abstract: With the increasing sophistication of online survey tools and the
  necessity of distanced research during the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of
  online questionnaires for research purposes has proliferated. Still, many
  researchers undertake online survey research without knowledge of the
  prevalence and likelihood of experiencing survey questionnaire fraud nor
  familiarity with measures used to identify fraud once it has occurred. This
  research note is based on the experience of researchers across four sites who
  implemented an online survey of familiesâ€™ experiences with COVID-19 in the
  U.S. that was subject to substantial fraud. By the end of data collection,
  over 70% of responses were flagged as fraudulent with duplicate IP addresses
  and concurrent start/end times representing the most common indicators of
  fraud observed. We offer lessons learned to illustrate the sophisticated
  nature of fraud in online research and the importance of multi-pronged
  strategies to detect and limit online survey questionnaire fraud.
