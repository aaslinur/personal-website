abstract: Contraceptive intention is an important woman-centered indicator for
  family planning. Yet, few studies have examined the determinants of women or
  couples actualizing their contraceptive intentions. We leverage panel data
  from the Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) survey in Ethiopia to examine
  these dynamics among a pregnancy cohort, over the first year postpartum. Using
  cluster analysis on intent-to-use trajectories, we find distinct patterns
  across wealth categories, education levels, and regions. Additionally, we find
  that receiving family planning counseling in both antenatal and postnatal care
  visits led to a higher likelihood of intending to use. However, counseling did
  not increase the odds of actualization. We argue that examining actualization
  through model-based approaches like cluster analysis generates better insight
  into woman-centered contraceptive demand and provides stronger evidence for
  strengthening postpartum family planning interventions, than quantifying
  contraceptive use alone. Modeling postpartum actualization trajectories can
  shed light on the barriers to women’s and couple’s reproductive autonomy and
  inform future investments in both upstream development of better contraceptive
  methods and downstream implementation.
